This comes with absoutly no warrently what so ever for the following reason:

I am not a developer
&
I wrote most of this when i was drunk at 3 am.

However, it does work and graphs out the users chip value from the game log.

Run like this:

python.exe .\main.py --filename poker_now_log_ggozQnErBjDnqqCNmA4A8ZJbY.csv --onscreen false

or 
python.exe .\main.py -f poker_now_log_ggozQnErBjDnqqCNmA4A8ZJbY.csv -o false

it will output your png to your working directory and show on screen if -o is true
